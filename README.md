#### Deployment  
To deploy run `./deploy.sh` (make sure it is executable)  

#### The `submodule` folder
Do not delete the `submodule` folder!
It is where the files to be deployed will reside when you run the `./deploy.sh`.  

#### Development  
Apply all your changes only in the `stage` branch.
This means you must always branch out from the `stage` branch and also when merging changes.

## Do not merge the `stage` branch to master!
